  "story_2": "Marriage come from many circumstances. There are long-term lovers whose story can be a full-length novel-long, and there are people like us who get to know each other, fall in love and decide to grow old together in just 9 months. Figuratively said by the husband: \"It's fate\". Or speak frankly by the wife: \"good fit: to eat, to play, and to work\". Anyway, \"right people, right time\". Where there is love there is life.",

Yet, we have decided to build a perfect family by our own standards: peace, harmony, solidarity, good learners, good players. Our home are going to have a trust-worthy, steady hubby, and a spouse who keep dreaming but will be more gentle and thoughtful in 10-folds.",
