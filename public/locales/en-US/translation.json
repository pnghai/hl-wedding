  "story_2": "Marriage come from many circumstances. There are long-term lovers whose story can be a full-length novel-long, and there are people like us who get to know each other, fall in love and decide to grow old together in just 9 months. Figuratively said by the husband: \"It's fate\". Or speak frankly by the wife: \"good fit: to eat, to play, and to work\". Anyway, \"right people, right time\". Where there is love there is life.",
  "story_3": "We are both flawed individuals. One is thoughtless, childish, who often cries on the inside, yet aggressive, resourceful ganker. Another is thoughtfulness, sometimes stubborn, and usually have one's head in the clouds, and is throwing-shade lover. Yet, we have decided to build a perfect family by our own standards: peace, harmony, solidarity, good learners, good players. Our home are going to have a trust-worthy, steady hubby, and a wifey who keep dreaming but will be more gentle and thoughtful in 10-folds.",
